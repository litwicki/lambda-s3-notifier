## Getting Started

### Install AWS CLI

First, make sure you have installed the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)

### Configure AWS CLI

Configuring the CLI requires you have an AWS account with ACCESS KEY and SECRET.

### SAM Local
Finally, you'll want to install [SAM Local](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local), so you can debug/work locally; or maybe not if you like to live dangerously.
